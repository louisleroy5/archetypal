# Summary

`archetypal` is a Python package that helps handle collections of building archetypes. It
offers 2 majors functionalities:
1. The conversion of [EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net) IDF models to [UMI Template
 Files](http://web.mit.edu/sustainabledesignlab/projects/umi/index.html);
2. The conversion of [EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net) IDF models to
Trnsys [TrnBuild](http://www.trnsys.com/features/suite-of-tools.php) Models (compatible
with the multizone building model).

## EnergyPlus to TRNBuild

## EnergyPlus to UMI Template
It aims to provide a solution to the problem of
scale and lack of data presented in the previous chapter. The algorithm approximates the
non-geometric parameters of a multi-zone BEM by dissecting and combining core-zones and
perimeter -zones. The procedure is an attempt to streamline the creation of UBEM models
based on the Shoeboxer method [@Dogan:2017] by accelerating the creation of building
archetype templates. As we will discuss, this approach introduces a robust method to
convert detailed multi-zone models to archetype templates, striped of geometric
properties. The templates then allow the creation of large numbers of contextually-award
buildings which abstract their thermo-physical properties from the archetype template,
ultimately recreating geometric models.

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$
