Translator IDF to BUI
============

The necessity of translating IDF files (EnergyPlus input files) to BUI files (TRNBuild input files) emerged from the
need of modeling building archetypes1. Knowing that a lot of different models from different sources (NECB and US-DOE)
have already been developed under EnergyPlus, and it can be a tedious task to create a multizone building in a model
editor (e.g. TRNBuild), we assume the development of a file translator could be useful for simulationist.
