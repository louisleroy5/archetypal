Convert IDF to UMI
==================

The IDF to UMI converter generates an Umi Template from one or more EnergyPlus models (IDF file). The conversion is
performed by simpliying a multi-zone and geometric model to a 2-zone and non-geometric template. In other words, a
complex EnergyPlus model is be converted to a generalized core- and perimeter-zone with aggregated performances.
